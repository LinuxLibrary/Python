# Python Built-ins and Modules
==============================

Strings (str) :
---------------
A string os simply a sequence of characters. The string type "str" is a powerful flexible means
for manipulating string data.

Creating strings:
-----------------
The most common way to create a string is to surround the text with quotation marks:
In [1]: string1 = 'This is a string'
In [2]: string2 = "This is another string"
In [3]: string3 = '''This is still another string'''
In [4]: string4 = """And one more string"""
In [5]: type(string1), type(string2), type(string3), type(string4)
Out[5]: (<type 'str'>, <type 'str'>, <type 'str'>, <type 'str'>)
Single, double, and triple quotation marks accomplish the same thing: they all create
an object of type str.

This is a distinction that Python does not make. Python leaves the distinction to the
programmer. For example, if you needed to embed double quotation marks within the
string and did not want to have to escape them (with a backslash). Conversely, if you
needed to embed single quotes within the string and did not want to have to escape
them, you would use double quotes.

In [1]: s = "This is a string with 'quotes' in it"
In [2]: s
Out[2]: "This is a string with 'quotes' in it"

In [7]: s = '''this is a
...: multiline string'''
In [8]: s
Out[8]: 'this is a\nmultiline string'
