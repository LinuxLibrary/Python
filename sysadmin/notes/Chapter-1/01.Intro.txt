To list  the contents in a directory we use "ls" command with several options.
For example i want to list the contents in the "/" directory and i want to use
"ls" command along with "-ltrh" option.
In Bash we normally use in the following way.
# ls -ltrh /

To accomplish in Python we need to use the "subprocess" module. To use any module
we need to import it first.

subprocess.call(["some_command", "some_argument", "another_argument_or_path"])

>>> import subprocess
>>> subprocess.call(["ls", "-ltrh", "/"])

If we don't want to split the arguments we can use the full command along with 
arguments in the following way. The only thing we need to do is, we need to make 
the subprocess to execute our command in shell.

>>> subprocess.call("df -hT", shell=True)
