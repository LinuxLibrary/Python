# Reusing code with import statement
====================================

Save the functions along with importing the subprocess module to a python program.
Now for testing purpose try to execute the below subprocess call in iPython console

import subprocess
subprocess.call(["pwd"])

Now copy your program to the resulted directory. At this poing you can use your
python program like a Python module. But all you need to do is you should not use the
python suffix say ".py" and you can import the program like a module like below.

import pysysinfo

Now in this program we have noticed that all the code is being called at once while we
import the module. But we only need the function should be executed at the command line.
In the sense we need to get the output depending on our choice at the command line.
For that copy the existing program into a pysysinfo_2.py and add the below few lines by
replacing the last line "main()"

if __name__ == "__main__":
	main()

Now after importing the module try to give your program name and a dot after it, press the
TAB button and now you will be able to see all the functions of your program.

In [2]: pysysinfo_2.
pysysinfo_2.disk_func   pysysinfo_2.main        pysysinfo_2.py          pysysinfo_2.pyc         pysysinfo_2.subprocess  pysysinfo_2.uname_func
