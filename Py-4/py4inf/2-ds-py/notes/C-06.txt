We have more operators to work on the string data. Some of those include the below operators.

- find()
- index()
- upper()
- lower()
- replace()
- strip()
- lstrip()
- rstrip()
- startswith()
- endswith()
- split()
- splitlines()
- join()

We also can do some more additional search on the string data using the regular exressions.
For that we need to import the "re" module/library.
