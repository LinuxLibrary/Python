Programs that surf the Web:
---------------------------

Till now we have been through the sockets and urllib.
But the most important thing here we need to discuss is if we are going through a HTML page
which contains links to other pages or sites then it would be quite difficult for us to 
handle such situation as parsing through the document for "href" links and there after we need
to get the links from there. For this purpose we have an excellent library "BeautifulSoup"
to accomplish our task. This library will searches for the tags in the html page.

So in our case the reference links will come under the anchor tags <a>...</a>
So we need to search the anchor tags and we can get the links using the BeautifulSoup module.
Below is a sample program for the use of this library.


import urllib
from BeautifulSoup import *

url = raw_input('Enter - ')
html = urllib.urlopen(url).read()
soup = BeautifulSoup(html)
tags = soup('a')

for tag in tags:
	print tag.get('href', None)
