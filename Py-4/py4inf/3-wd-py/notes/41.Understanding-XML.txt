Understanding XML (eXtensible Markup Language):
-----------------------------------------------

XML looks very similar to HTML, but XML is more structured than HTML. Here
is a sample of an XML document:

<person>
 <name>Chuck</name>
 <phone type="intl">
  +1 734 303 4456
 </phone>
 <email hide="yes"/>
</person>

Often it is helpful to think of an XML document as a tree structure where there
is a top tag person and other tags such as phone are drawn as children of their
parent nodes.
