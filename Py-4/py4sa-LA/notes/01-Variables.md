# Python Variables

- Variables are used to store values and recall in the programs
- While naming the variables we need to follow some rules
	- Need to be started with (_) or (a-z) or (A-Z) or combination of these
	- Should not be started with numbers
- Variables are 3 types
	- string (Anything enclosed in quotes either it can be a number)

	> We can concatinate the strings, but we can't concatinate string with either int or float

	- int
	- float
- type() function can be used to determine the type of the variable(string|int|float)
- str() function can be used to convert something to string as needed
- int() can be use to convert numbers which stored as strings to integers
- float() can be used to convert integers to float values
