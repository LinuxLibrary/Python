# Python Dictionaries

- Python dictionary is an unordered collection of items. While other compound data types have only value as an element, a dictionary has a key: value pair.
- Dictionaries are optimized to retrieve values when the key is known.
- An item has a key and the corresponding value expressed as a pair, key: value.
- Dictionaries can be contained in lists and vice versa. But what's the difference between lists and dictionaries? Lists are ordered sets of objects, whereas dictionaries are unordered sets. But the main difference is that items in dictionaries are accessed via keys and not via their position. A dictionary is an associative array (also known as hashes). Any key of the dictionary is associated (or mapped) to a value. The values of a dictionary can be any Python data type. So dictionaries are unordered key-value-pairs. 
- Dictionaries don't support the sequence operation of the sequence data types like strings, tuples and lists. Dictionaries belong to the built-in mapping type. They are the sole representative of this kind!
- Each key is separated from its value by a colon (:), the items are separated by commas, and the whole thing is enclosed in curly braces. An empty dictionary without any items is written with just two curly braces, like this: {}.
