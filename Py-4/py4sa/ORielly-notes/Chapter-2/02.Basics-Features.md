# Basics - Features
===================

Tab Completion:
---------------
It is important to have the tab completion feature. It is used to list 
the sub modules with in a module. After importing the module at the prompt
we can know what all the sub-modules are present in that module by simply
typing the module name dot TAB (<module>.TAB).
For example to list the contents in the OS module.
```
In [19]: import os

In [20]: os.
Display all 218 possibilities? (y or n)
os.EX_CANTCREAT      os.O_NOCTTY          os.UserDict          os.devnull           
os.getcwdu           os.makedirs          os.setegid           os.sysconf
os.EX_CONFIG         os.O_NOFOLLOW        os.WCONTINUED        os.dup               
.
```
To configure the TAB completion feature in Python we need to do the following.
```
>>> import rlcompleter, readline
>>> readline.parse_and_bind('tab: complete')
>>> import os
>>> os.
Display all 249 possibilities? (y or n)
os.EX_CANTCREAT             os.SEEK_END                 os.__reduce__(              
os.execve(                  os.lstat(                   os.setuid(
os.EX_CONFIG                os.SEEK_SET                 os.__reduce_ex__(           
.
```
Magic-Edit:
-----------

Magic edit is a special feature in IPython. 
Two of the magic functions can help you made through this all of this functionality 
and sort what might be useful for you. The first magic function is "lsmagic" which 
lists all the magic functions. The first magic function is "lsmagic" which 
lists all the magic functions. Another way to list the magic functions in a nice
way is to type %.<TAB>. We have a total of 69 magic functions.

We can get help of each of those individual functions too and can know about those
functions. For example we have the %alias function. To know about it
```
In [1]: %alias ?
```
This will get the help page of the alias function.
