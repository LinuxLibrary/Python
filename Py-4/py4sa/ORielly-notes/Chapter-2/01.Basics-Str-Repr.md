# Basics - String representation
================================

We know that we store some strings in variables to use those depending on the use.
But while in use strings will have some different behavior. We normally use print
to display the string within a variable. But it is an unofficial way using the 
strings. The official way of using the strings is to use the bare variable. Below
is the example which shows how to use those.
```
In [1]: a = 1
In [2]: print a
1
In [3]: a
Out[3]: 1
```
This distinction is very important when we are dealing with the custom classes than
when we are dealing with built-in classes. To have an indetailed explanation we'll 
do this through a program.
```
In [13]: class DoubleRep(object):
   ....:     def __str__(self):
   ....:         return "Hi, I'm a __str__"
   ....:     def __repr__(self):
   ....:         return "Hi, I'm a __repr__"
   ....:     

In [14]: dr = DoubleRep()

In [15]: print dr
Hi, I'm a __str__

In [16]: dr
Out[16]: Hi, I'm a __repr__
```
This means that if we simply type the name of the variable then we Python / IPython 
will displays is the "Official" string representation and if we use the print Python
/ IPython will displays is the "Un-Official" string representation.

__str__ and __repr__ are 2 special methods where __str__ will be called when the un-
official method is needed and __repr__ will be called when the official method is 
needed.

In Python in general, __str__ is what gets called when we call str(obj) on an object
or when it is used in a formatted string like : "%s" % obj. And when repr(obj) gets 
called or when it is used in a formatted string like : "%r" % obj, __repr__ is what 
gets called.
