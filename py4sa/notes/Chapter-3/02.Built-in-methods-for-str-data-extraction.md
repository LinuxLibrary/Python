# BUILT-IN METHODS FOR STR DATA EXTRACTION
------------------------------------------
One of the method of str data extraction is "in" and "not in" text operators.
Technically "in" and "not in" test operators call a method on your str object,
__contains__(). We can use both "in" and "not in" to determine if a string is
a part of another string.
```
In [1]: import subprocess
In [2]: res = subprocess.Popen(['uname', '-ior'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
In [3]: uname = res.stdout.read().strip()
In [4]: uname
Out[4]: '4.2.0-c9 x86_64 GNU/Linux'
In [5]: 'Linux' in uname
Out[5]: True
In [6]: 'Linux' not in uname                                                                                                                           
Out[6]: False
```
USING FIND() AND INDEX():
-------------------------

If string2 contains string1, string1 in string2 returns True, otherwise, it returns
False. So, checking to see if "Linux" was in our uname string returned True, but checking
to see if "Unix" was in our uname returned false.Sometimes you only need to know if a 
string is a substring of another string. Other times, you need to know where in a string 
the substring occurs. find() and index() let you do that.
```
In [19]: uname.index('Linux')
Out[19]: 20
In [20]: uname.find('Linux')
Out[20]: 20
In [23]: uname.find('Debian')
Out[23]: -1
In [24]: uname.index('Debian')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-24-97ca2e4d7f71> in <module>()
----> 1 uname.index('Debian')

ValueError: substring not found
```
If string1 is in string2, string2.find(string1) returns
the index of the first character of string1, otherwise, it returns –1.

STRING SLICE:
-------------
```
In [13]: smp_index = uname.index('SMP')
In [14]: smp_index
Out[14]: 9
In [15]: uname[smp_index:]
Out[15]: 'SMP Tue Feb 12 02:46:46 UTC 2008'
In [16]: uname[:smp_index]
Out[16]: 'Linux #1 '
In [17]: uname
Out[17]: 'Linux #1 SMP Tue Feb 12 02:46:46 UTC 2008'
```
We were able to see every character from the index of finding "SMP" to the end of the
string with the slice syntax string[index:]. We were also able to see every character
from the beginning of the uname string to the index of finding "SMP" with the slice syntax
string[:index]. The slight variation between these two is which side of the index the
colon (:) finds itself on.

USING STARTSWITH() AND ENDSWITH():
------------------------------------

Two other strings that are occasionally methods are startswith() and endswith(). As
their names imply, they can help you determine whether a string “starts with” or “ends
with” a particular substring.
```
In [1]: some_string = "Raymond Luxury-Yacht"
In [2]: some_string.startswith("Raymond")
Out[2]: True
In [3]: some_string.startswith("Throatwarbler")
Out[3]: False
In [4]: some_string.endswith("Luxury-Yacht")
Out[4]: True
In [5]: some_string.endswith("Mangrove")
Out[5]: False
```
METHODS TO WORK ON WHITE SPACES USING LSTRIP(), RSTRIP() AND STRIP():
---------------------------------------------------------------------

We have some other methods to remove the white spaces(trailing, ending and both).
- lstrip() - Used to remove trailing white spaces.
	Usage : some_string.lstrip()
- rstrip() - Used to remove ending white spaces.
	Usage : some_string.rstrip()
- strip() - Used to remove both trailing and ending white spaces.
	Usage : some_string.strip()
```
In [11]: new_string = "  Test String  "
In [12]: new_string
Out[12]: '  Test String  '
In [13]: new_string.lstrip()
Out[13]: 'Test String  '
In [14]: new_string.rstrip()
Out[14]: '  Test String'
In [15]: new_string.strip()
Out[15]: 'Test String'
```
These will not only remove the white spaces we can use these as we need. Means if we need 
to remove any characters at trailing or ending then we can use these. For example if we 
have '<' at begining and '>' characters at the begining and ending then we'll see how can 
we remove these.
```
In [16]: xml_tag = "<some_tag>"
In [17]: xml_tag
Out[17]: '<some_tag>'
In [18]: xml_tag.lstrip("<")
Out[18]: 'some_tag>'
In [19]: xml_tag.rstrip(">")
Out[19]: '<some_tag'
In [20]: xml_tag.lstrip("<").rstrip(">")
Out[20]: 'some_tag'
In [21]: xml_tag.strip("<").strip(">")
Out[21]: 'some_tag'
In [22]: xml_tag.strip("<>")
Out[22]: 'some_tag'
```
You might have assumed that the strip()s stripped off an exact occurrence of the string
you fed it, but the strips actually remove any sequential occurrence of the specified
characters from the appropriate side of the string. In that last example, we told
strip() to remove "<>". That doesn’t mean to exactly match "<>" and remove any
occurrences of those two characters that are adjacent to one another in that order; it
means remove any occurrences of "<" or ">" that are adjacent to one another on either
end of the string.
```
In [28]: gt_lt_str = "<><><>gt lt str<><><>"
In [29]: gt_lt_str.strip("<>")
Out[29]: 'gt lt str'
In [30]: gt_lt_str.strip("><")
Out[30]: 'gt lt str'

In [35]: foo_str = "<fooooooo>blah<foo>"
In [36]: foo_str.strip("<foo>")
Out[36]: 'blah'
In [37]: foo_str.strip("<fo>")
Out[37]: 'blah'
In [38]: foo_str.strip("><fo")
Out[38]: 'blah'
In [39]: foo_str.strip("><of")
Out[39]: 'blah'
```
USING UPPER() and LOWER() METHODS:
----------------------------------

The methods upper() and lower() are useful, particularly when you need to compare
two strings without regard to whether the characters are upper- or lowercase.
```
In [40]: mixed_string = "TEst StrInG"
In [41]: mixed_string == "TEST STRING"                                                                                                                                       
Out[41]: False
In [42]: mixed_string == "test string"
Out[42]: False
In [43]: mixed_string.lower() == "test string"                                                                                                                                    
Out[43]: True
In [44]: mixed_string.upper() == "TEST STRING"                                                                                                                                    
Out[44]: True
In [45]: mixed_string.lower()
Out[45]: 'test string'
In [46]: mixed_string.upper()
Out[46]: 'TEST STRING'
```
USING SPLIT() METHOD:
---------------------

But what if you only want to split the string on the first “n” occurrences of the specified
delimiters? Split() takes a second parameter, called max_split. When an integer value for max_split 
is passed in, split() will only split the string the number of times the max_split argument dictates:
```
>>> two_field_string = "8675309,This is a freeform, plain text, string"
>>> two_field_string.split(',',1)
['8675309', 'This is a freeform, plain text, string']
```
We split on a comma and told split() to only split on the first occurrence of the delimiter.

If you need to split on whitespace in order to retrieve, for example, words from a piece
of prose-like text, split() is an easy tool for accomplishing that:
```
>>> prosaic_string = "Insert your clever little piece of text here."
>>> prosaic_string.split()
['Insert', 'your', 'clever', 'little', 'piece', 'of', 'text', 'here.']
```
This method is more useful in programming. While programming we can assign the split method output to a 
string variable and there after we can easily loop through that.
```
>>> line = prosaic_string.split()
>>> for word in line:
...     print word
...
Insert
your
clever
little
piece
of
text
here.
```
Most of the time, you will probably see the results you expected to see. However, if you
have a multiline piece of text, you might see results that you were not expecting. Often,
when you have a multiline piece of text, you intend to deal with one line at a time. But
you might find that the program split on every word in the string:
```
>>> multiline_string = """This
... is
... a multiline
... piece of
... text"""
>>> multiline_string
'This\nis\na multiline\npiece of\ntext'
>>> multiline_string.split()
['This', 'is', 'a', 'multiline', 'piece', 'of', 'text']
>>> multiline_string.splitlines()
['This', 'is', 'a multiline', 'piece of', 'text']
```
Sometimes you don’t want to pull a string apart or extract information from it; sometimes
you need to piece a string together from data you already have. In these cases,
join() can help:
```
>>> some_list = ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four']
>>> ','.join(some_list)
'one,two,three,four'
>>> ', '.join(some_list)
'one, two, three, four'
>>> '\t'.join(some_list)
'one\ttwo\tthree\tfour'
>>> ''.join(some_list)
'onetwothreefour'
```
The last method for creating or modifying strings of text is the replace() method.
Replace() takes two arguments: the string that is to be replaced and the string to replace
it with, respectively. Here is a simple replace() example:
```
In [1]: replacable_string = "trancendental hibernational nation"
In [2]: replacable_string.replace("nation", "natty")
Out[2]: 'trancendental hibernattyal natty'
```
Notice that replace() doesn’t care if the string to replace is in the middle of a word or
if it is a full word. So, in cases in which you need to replace only a specific sequence of
characters with another specific sequence of characters, replace() is the tool to use.


UNICODED STRINGS:
-----------------

When you see any characters on a computer screen, the computer is dealing with those charac
-ters internally as numbers. Until Unicode, there were many different sets of number-to-cha
-racter mappings, depending on the language and platform. Unicode is a standard that provid
-es a single number-to-character mapping regardless of the language, platform, or even the
program that is dealing with the text.

Creating a Unicode string is as simple as creating a regular string:
```
In [1]: unicode_string = u'this is a unicode string'
In [2]: unicode_string
Out[2]: u'this is a unicode string'
In [3]: print unicode_string
this is a unicode string
```
Or, you can use the built-in unicode() function:
```
In [4]: unicode('this is a unicode string')
Out[4]: u'this is a unicode string'
```
