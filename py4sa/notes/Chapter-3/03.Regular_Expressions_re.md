# USING REGULAR EXPRESSIONS WITH THE re LIBRARY :
-------------------------------------------------
```
^	 -	Matches the beginning of the line
$ 	 -	Matches the ending of the line
.	 -	Matches any character
\s	 -	Matches a white space
\S	 -	Matches a non-whitespace character
*	 -	Repeats a character zero or more times
*?	 -	Repeats a character zero or more times (non-greedy)
+	 -	Repeats a character one or more times
+?	 -	Repeats a character one or more times (non-greedy)
[qwert]	 -	Matches a single character in the listed set
[^XYZ]	 -	Matches a single character not in the listed set
[a-z0-9] -	The set of characters can include a range
(	 -	Indicates where string extraction is to start
)	 -	Indicates where string extraction is to end

There are two ways to work with regular expressions in Python. The first is to use the
functions in the re module directly, as in the previous example. The second is to create
a compiled regular expression object and use the methods on that object. So what is a co
-mpiled regular expression? It is simply an object that was created by passing in a patt
-ern to re.compile(); it contains a number of regular expression methods that were creat
-ed by passing in a pattern to re.compile(). There are two primary differences between u
-sing the compiled and noncompiled examples. First, instead of keeping a reference to th
-e regular expression pattern "{{(.*?)}}", we created a compiled regular expression obje
-ct and used the pattern to create it. Second, instead of calling findall() on the re mo
-dule, we called findall() on the compiled regular expression object.

Simple regular expression, compiled pattern
```
In [1]: import re
In [2]: re_obj = re.compile("{{(.*?)}}")
In [3]: some_string = "this is a string with {{words}} embedded in\
...: {{curly brackets}} to show an {{example}} of {{regular expressions}}"
In [4]: for match in re_obj.findall(some_string):
...: print "MATCH->", match
...:
MATCH-> words
MATCH-> curly brackets
MATCH-> example
MATCH-> regular expressions
```
-----------------------------------------------

> The '*', '+', and '?' qualifiers are all greedy; they match as much text as possible. Sometimes this behavior isn’t desired; if the RE <.*> is matched against '<H1>title</H1>', it will match the entire string, and not just '<H1>'. Adding '?' after the qualifier makes it perform the match in non-greedy or minimal fashion; as few characters as possible will be matched. Using .*? in the previous expression will match only '<H1>'.

The four primary regular expression methods (or functions) which are most likely to be u
sed often are findall(), finditer(), match(), and search(). You might also find yourself
using split() and sub(), but probably not as often as you will use the others. Findall()
will find all occurrences of the specified pattern in the search string. If findall() ma
-tches the pattern, the type of data structure it will return will depend on whether the
pattern specified a group.

If you didn’t specify a group in the regular expression pattern but a match is found,
findall() will return a list of strings. For example:
```
In [1]: import re
In [2]: re_obj = re.compile(r'\bt.*?e\b')
In [3]: re_obj.findall("time tame tune tint tire")
Out[3]: ['time', 'tame', 'tune', 'tint tire']
```
The pattern doesn’t specify any groups, so findall() returns a list of strings. An inter
-esting side point is that the last element of the returned list contains two words, tin
-t and tire. The regular expression was intended to match words that start with “t” and
end with “e”. But the .*? command matches anything, including whitespace. Findall() matc
-hed everything it was supposed to. It found a word which started with “t” (tint). It co
-ntinued looking through the string until it found a word that ended with “e” (tire). So,
the match “tint tire” was appropriate. To exclude the whitespace, you would use 
r'\bt\w*e\b':
```
In [4]: re_obj = re.compile(r'\bt\w*e\b')
In [5]: re_obj.findall("time tame tune tint tire")
Out[5]: ['time', 'tame', 'tune', 'tire']
```
Simple grouped group with findall( )
```
In [1]: import re
In [2]: re_obj = re.compile(r"""(A\W+\b(big|small)\b\W+\b
...: (brown|purple)\b\W+\b(cow|dog)\b\W+\b(ran|jumped)\b\W+\b
...: (to|down)\b\W+\b(the)\b\W+\b(street|moon).*?\.)""",
...: re.VERBOSE)
In [3]: re_obj.findall('A big brown dog ran down the street. \
...: A small purple cow jumped to the moon.')
Out[3]:
[('A big brown dog ran down the street.',
'big',
'brown',
'dog',
'ran',
'down',
'the',
'street'),
('A small purple cow jumped to the moon.',
'small',
'purple',
'cow',
'jumped',
'to',
'the',
'moon')]
```
Notice that the last argument to re.compile() was re.VERBOSE. This allowed us to write
the regular expression string in verbose mode, which simply means that we were able to
split the regular expression across lines without the split interfering with the patte
-rn matching. The re.VERBOSE function lets you write simpler regular expressions, so i
-t is a great tool for improving the maintenance of code that includes regular express
-ions.

Search() and match() calls accept start and end parameters that specify the places in a
string at which Python should start and end looking for a pattern.

Start and end parameters for search( ) and match( )
```
In [6]: re_obj.search(search_string, pos=1)
Out[6]: <_sre.SRE_Match object at 0xabe030>
In [7]: re_obj.match(search_string, pos=1)
Out[7]: <_sre.SRE_Match object at 0xabe098>
In [8]: re_obj.search(search_string, pos=1, endpos=3)
In [9]: re_obj.match(search_string, pos=1, endpos=3)
In [10]:
```
