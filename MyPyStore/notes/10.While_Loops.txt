While Loops :
-------------
This loop is like an until statement.
It will keep on looping till the given condition satisfies either it might be true or false.
This will works as below

>>> while condition-is-true / false perform action
This will perform the action only if the condition-is-true / false.
If the condition didn't match then this will be unhandy.
And will become an indefinite loop.

>>> count = 0
>>> while count <= 10:
...  print count
...  count += 1
